kernel.md — The PTDT-OS Kernel Specification
This document explains the beating heart of PTDT-OS:
the Golden Kernel, how it makes decisions, how it processes reports, and how developers must integrate with it.
PTDT-OS Kernel Specification (kernel.md)
1. Purpose of the Kernel
The PTDT-OS Kernel is the universal safety coordinator responsible for:
collecting divergence reports from multiple domains
computing global safety signals
evaluating delta, delta-rate, and safety thresholds
issuing throttle commands
triggering irreversible global veto when needed
maintaining a cryptographically provable event chain
Every domain (AI, Robotics, Brain, Road, Quantum, etc.) plugs into the Kernel through a simple reporting API.
The Kernel is domain-agnostic and does not rely on any proprietary SDKs.
2. Core Responsibilities
2.1 Aggregate Divergence
The Kernel receives multiple GoldenReport objects per cycle, each containing:
delta (0.0–1.0)
delta-rate
local safety state
recommended throttle
timestamp
cryptographic signature (v3.0+)
It selects the worst domain based on:
highest delta
highest delta-rate
highest severity state (SAFE < CAUTION < DANGER < CATASTROPHIC)
This worst-case value becomes the global state.
This ensures no domain can “hide” dangerous signals behind others.
3. Global State Machine
PTDT-OS computes the system-wide safety state:
SAFE — normal conditions
CAUTION — emerging instability
DANGER — severe divergence, throttling required
CATASTROPHIC — global veto
The Kernel ensures deterministic behavior:
If any domain enters CATASTROPHIC or crosses delta/delta-rate thresholds, all systems must comply.
4. Throttle Computation
Throttle is derived from the minimum of all domain throttles.
Reason:
If even one subsystem is unstable, reducing global speed prevents cascading failures.
Throttle is a continuous value from 0.0 to 1.0:
1.0 = full speed
0.5 = constrained
0.1 = emergency limitation
0.0 = halt
Throttle output is intended to be connected to:
robot motion limits
vehicle acceleration controllers
AI training step regulators
quantum circuit depths
simulation speeds
any adjustable operational rate
5. Cryptographic Provenance (v3.0+)
Every report added to history is:
Hashed with a BLAKE2b digest (32 bytes)
Signed with Ed25519 hardware-bound private key
Chained into a Merkle-like rolling root
This provides:
tamper-evidence
traceable audit logs
post-incident reconstruction
regulator-ready proofs
manufacturer liability protection
Even if a subsystem is compromised, the Kernel log cannot be falsified.
6. Merkle Chain Operation
Each report includes:
prev_hash
report_hash
signature
new_root = blake2b(prev_root + report_hash) 
The chain never resets unless the operator performs a secure wipe (factory reset)
The Kernel does not care what hardware, sensors, or models produced these values.
This loose coupling allows:
robotics labs
vehicle OEMs
AI companies
neurotech firms
quantum computing teams
to integrate without sharing proprietary code.
10. Why This Kernel Model Works
This design offers:
Universality across industries
Extreme simplicity in integration
Strong cryptographic foundations
Compatibility with safety regulators
Future-proof structure for interoperable AGI-era systems
The Kernel is intentionally minimalist because complexity is a safety risk.
PTDT-OS 3.0 is built to be:
reliable
explainable
verifiable
enforceable
compatible with ultra-fast systems
It is the core immunity layer for future civilization-scale technological systems.
